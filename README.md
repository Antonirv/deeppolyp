### Experiment 5 (Deconv_init, lr=1e-4, l2=1e-5, He(Relu), voids)
Note that here the performance is worse because we don't count the void class that was very easy to detect
![image](./images/deconv_init_voids.png)

## Posible problems to solve
 1. Polyp/No polyp image classification
 2. Polyp/Lumen/Specularity detection 
 3. Image semantic segmentation for the classes: Polyp/Lumen/Specularity/Void/Background
 4. Instance segmentation (Tracking of Polyps/Lumen/Specularities)
 5. Video Segmentacion
 6. Domain Adaptation
 7. Polyp classification (There are several types of polyps)
 
## Experiment configurations
 1. Intra pacient evaluation
 2. Inter pacient evaluation
 3. Inter camera evaluation
 4. Inter polyp evaluation
 
## First paper contributions
 1. Generate a public dataset that allows to perform different experiments
 2. Test a set of baselines for this dataset
  1, Jorge's published methods
  2. Deep learning methods: FCN8 y UNET
 
## Dataset
 1. Two datasets with: 300 and 612 color and fully annotated frames
 2. CVC-300 dataset is acquired at Irland and CVC-612 at Spain. The cameras are different.
 2. Image semantic annotation for each frame with the classes: Void(0)/Background(1)/Polyp(2)/Specularity(3)/Lumen(4)
 3. For each frame this extra metadata:
   1. Frame ID (In the dataset)
   2. Frame ID (In the original video) This data still is not available
   3. Patiend ID
   4. Polyp ID

## Framework
